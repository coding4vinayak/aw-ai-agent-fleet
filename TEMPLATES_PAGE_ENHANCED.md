# ✅ **TEMPLATES PAGE COMPLETELY ENHANCED!**

## 🎯 **Font Visibility & Team Details - FIXED!**

I've completely fixed the font visibility issues and added comprehensive team viewing capabilities to the templates page.

## 🔧 **FONT VISIBILITY FIXES APPLIED**

### **✅ 1. Enhanced Text Contrast**
- **Team Names**: Now bold and larger (`text-lg font-bold`)

- **Team Size**: Prominent blue text (`text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 font-semibold`)

### **✅ 2. Nuclear CSS Overrides**
Applied the strongest possible CSS rules to force text visibility:
```css
/* Nuclear option - force ALL text to be visible in dark mode */
html.dark * {
    color: #F9FAFB !important;
}

html.dark .text-gray-600,
html.dark .text-gray-500,
html.dark .text-gray-400 {
    color: #D1D5DB !important;
}

/* Force role badges to be highly visible */
html.dark .template-card .bg-blue-100 {
    background-color: #1E40AF !important;
    color: #FFFFFF !important;
}
```

### **✅ 3. Role Badge Enhancement**
